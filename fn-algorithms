-l --list-fields

-h --hex

-o --output

-c --create

list-fields:
gather up the pretty printing code and put it in one function
make it take an argument to control if hex values are printed/also printed.
make this the default behavior for no arguments

hex:
set the flag to make list print hex data

create:
-c flag
read <file> and create new footer based on <file>
defaults to -o <file>, that is, appending to given file.

output:
-o <out_file>
output to <out_file>

-c:
output footer created from <file>
seek to end of file and output footer.

-l:
same file behavior, but output footer read in from end of <file>
this is mostly only usefull if <out_file> is a new file.

*maybe* later enable editing of individual fields

c flag overrides l flag

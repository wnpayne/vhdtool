Currently working on:
figure out C/H/S algorithm? Implement it, so that I can add a VHD header to an already exisiting image file. Or create an image file and define the CHS in the header.
read those articles about sector alignment and figure out if that can work here. 
this should be fun!



fields to implement/understand/verify:

1. creator version
2. hostOS
3. time stamp
4. original/current size
5. disk geo
6. uuid pretty print



learn about bitfields!

separate code into .h and .c files

transfer test VHD file to work with
fix UUID number (eg do microsoft way with endianness)

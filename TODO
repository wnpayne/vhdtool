finish output testing
figure out when to open and close files. 
take account for errors and error messages!
goals:

read and change parts of current vhd files and vhd footer stubs.
create new vhd files
	for now: just concentrate on adding a footer to existing raw files. this seems the most useful, i
	then a wrapper script around this with fallocate or dd could set up the rest. Maybe do this with file seeking or writing zeros
	'by hand' in c if we need to/want to/ends up we need to respect geometry.

understand geometry
make pretty printing of all values
show values as hex (big endian, as stored in file) and base 10
make it easy to change values
make sure everything works in windows!

--------------------

Currently working on:
figure out C/H/S algorithm? Implement it, so that I can add a VHD header to an already exisiting image file. Or create an image file and define the CHS in the header.
read those articles about sector alignment and figure out if that can work here. 
this should be fun!



fields to implement/understand/verify:

1. creator version
2. hostOS
3. time stamp
4. original/current size
5. disk geo
6. uuid pretty print



learn about bitfields!

separate code into .h and .c files

transfer test VHD file to work with
fix UUID number (eg do microsoft way with endianness)

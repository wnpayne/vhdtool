fields to implement/understand/verify:
1. creator version
2. hostOS
3. time stamp
4. original/current size
5. disk geo
6. uuid pretty print



learn about bitfields!

separate code into .h and .c files

currently working on:

understand the checksum: can I sum the bytes and then use bitwise negation (by hand?)
and then achieve the correct checksum? also what is the checksum byte order?

how do I sum all the bytes, do a negation, and then print the same result as simply printing the checksum using printbytes() straight from the footer?


next up:

checksumming (computation and validation)


transfer test VHD file to work with
fix UUID number (eg do microsoft way with endianness)
